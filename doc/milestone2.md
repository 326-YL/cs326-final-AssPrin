   APIs we plan to use CRUD, obviously as well as the API provided by <a href="https://rawg.io/apidocs">RAWG</a>. Idealistically, I'd like to find an API that contains data on consoles as <a href="consolevariations.com">consolevariations</a> does, but we haven't found it yet.(Ben)

   get through it, we will learn from what we did.
