   APIs we plan to use CRUD, obviously as well as the API provided by <a href="https://rawg.io/apidocs">RAWG</a>. Idealistically, I'd like to find an API that contains data on consoles as <a href="consolevariations.com">consolevariations</a> does, but we haven't found it yet.(Ben)

   we are still working on our APIs, we are having troubles on server things and still learning how to work on it, but we will
   get through it, we will learn from what we are working on.
