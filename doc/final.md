  Our website is called Game Shelf, an idea by Ben McCann, and it is a website where one can catelogue different consoles and games that an individual owns. Inspired by MyAnimeList, the a site where individuals can list shows and personally rank each one. Ben has a console collection, and thought it would be awesome if there was a games/console collection website for people to show off what they have collected and the games they have played, as well as how they rank each one.<br><br>
  <b>User Interface</b>: Our website consists of 3 pages, an index home page, a collection page, and an explore page. The index page is fairly standard, it's used to show the user news information. The Collection page shows off a user's collection. Idealistically, it would work on a per-user basis, but we were unable to implement a login that keeps a user signed in. This page will show off consoles one has collected, as well as games they have collected in their generalized console category. The Explore page is where a user "collects" games and consoles. A user can explore via category or by the search bar. Unfortunately, we were unable to implement a game's database API to show games. We also didn't have time to add a system to add consoles to a user's list.<br><br>

  <b>APIs</b>: We unfortunately did not include any external APIs. We had plans for a news article API for the home page, as well as a game database API, but we were unable to implemement them. We do have internal routes sending data from the server database to our website, in the routes '/thedata' and 'thedatatoo'<br><br>
  <b>Database</b>: Our website has 3 databases; Users, Consoles, and Userownconsole. The User's database contains a automatically incrementing uid, username, and password. The consoles database contains cid (auto inc.), brand, kind, name, and img_url. Every console has a brand behind them, which we use for categorizing them, as well as a 'kind', which we use to generalize what the console is and what kind of games it can play. For instance, one can go to Ninteno > NES > NES Top Loader [NA]. Lastly, we have a img_url which contains an image for nearly every console. The Userownconsole is a database containing uid and cid, and every entry contains a user's id and a console id, with the idea to join databases to get a full database for the case needed. The primary case will be used on the collection page, where we INNER JOIN with the uid to get the data for a user's owned consoles.<br>

  <b>URL Routes</b>: We have a variety of routes, UI routes, login routes, data routes, and pure-testing-purposes routes. For the main UI routes, it contains the aforementioned '/', '/collection', '/explore'. The login routes are available when one presses 'sign in', and are at routes '/users/signup' and also '/users/login'. We have 2 data routes, which were mentioned prior; '/thedata' and '/thedatatoo'. Lastly, we have the pure-testing-purposes routes, which I should certainly stress that there will not be contained for long, only for as long as this website is used for this project; '/showusers', '/showconsole', and '/showuserownconsole'.<br><br>
  <b>Division of Labor</b>: The breakdown of the labor for this project is fairly simple, we assigned a page to a team member. Yang took the index, Ben took the collection, and Sam took the explore page. Yang set up the Heroku server. The server.js file was worked on by Ben and Yang, as well as the login system. Ben set up the database and created the console's database information.<br><br>
  <b>Ben's Conclusion</b>: This was a very stressful project to work on. Trying to learn Heroku and server code to make the website do as I desire was very difficult, as seen by how much I wasn't able to achieve. The website itself is cool, as well as generally fun to work on, but stressing over trying to figure out how systems worked and the ongoing realization that most of my ideals weren't going to happen is frustrating. I wish I knew how to connect routes with the 'a' element sooner, I wish I knew how to make a logged in user persist, I wish I had more specific Heroku information, on setup and database creation/implementation.<br>
  TEMPORARY, FOR YOU GUYS TO ADD YOUR OWN CONCLUSION: A conclusion describing your teamâ€™s experience in working on this project. This should include what you learned through the design and implementation process, the difficulties you encountered, what your team would have liked to know before starting the project that would have helped you later, and any other technical hurdles that your team encountered.
