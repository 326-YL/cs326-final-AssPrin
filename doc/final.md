  Our website is called Game Shelf, an idea by Ben McCann, and it is a website where one can catelogue different consoles and games that an individual owns. Inspired by MyAnimeList, the a site where individuals can list shows and personally rank each one. Ben has a console collection, and thought it would be awesome if there was a games/console collection website for people to show off what they have collected and the games they have played, as well as how they rank each one.<br><br>
  <b>User Interface</b>: Our website consists of 3 pages, an index home page, a collection page, and an explore page. The index page is fairly standard, it's used to show the user news information. The Collection page shows off a user's collection. Idealistically, it would work on a per-user basis, but we were unable to implement a login that keeps a user signed in. This page will show off consoles one has collected, as well as games they have collected in their generalized console category. The Explore page is where a user "collects" games and consoles. A user can explore via category or by the search bar. Unfortunately, we were unable to implement a game's database API to show games. We also didn't have time to add a system to add consoles to a user's list.<br><br>

  <b>APIs</b>: We unfortunately did not include any external APIs. We had plans for a news article API for the home page, as well as a game database API, but we were unable to implemement them. We do have internal routes sending data from the server database to our website, in the routes '/thedata' and 'thedatatoo'
