                Yesterday I was looking for something easy for dinner, 
                and phoned the nearest pizza-from-a-small-building. I ordered a large Canadian Pizza for pickup, and the person on the phone confirmed the location
                 and my phone before telling me I could pick it up in 30 minutes. At no point was price mentioned in this exchange. I had specifically ordered this
                because I was looking at the website and saw they had a large banner on their site which stated they had specific types of large pizzas for $16.99.
